 Round Robin Tournament Scheduler with Rest Days

A Python program that generates a round robin tournament schedule where each team gets rest day between matches. No team plays back-to-back, making it perfect for sports leagues, e-sports tournaments, or any round robin-style competitions.

Features

- Automatically generates a round robin schedule for any number of teams.
- Supports custom team names or auto-generated names.
- Prints the schedule round by round.
- Calculates total number of matches.

How It Works

Uses the circle method for round robin scheduling:

1. One team is fixed while the others rotate each round.
2. Matches are organized into rounds to guarantee rest between games.
